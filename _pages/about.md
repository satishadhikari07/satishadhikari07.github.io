Hi, I’m Satish Adhikari, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate with a bachelor’s degree from  <a href="https://elec.ku.edu.np//" target="_blank"> Kathmandu University</a>, Nepal. I am currently working at <a href="https://www.neaec.com.np/en/home" target="_blank"> NEA Engineering Company </a>, where I specialize in power transmission systems, substation design, and distribution networks.<br>

I have been actively contributing to projects that focus on the planning, design, and implementation of power infrastructure. My responsibilities include designing high-voltage substations, optimizing distribution systems, and ensuring the reliability and efficiency of power transmission networks. I have a keen interest in exploring cutting-edge technologies like renewable energy integration, grid automation, and sustainable power solutions. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to innovate and push the boundaries.<br>
